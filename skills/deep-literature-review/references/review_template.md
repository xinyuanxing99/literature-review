# Literature Review Template

## Overview

This template provides a structure for comprehensive but accessible literature reviews. Unlike academic publications, these reviews focus on understanding and knowledge exploration rather than formal publication requirements.

## Review Structure

### Title
Choose a clear, descriptive title that captures the topic.

### Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- What is the topic?
- Why does it matter?
- What are the main findings?
- Who would benefit from this review?

### Introduction (1-2 pages)
- Context and background
- Why this topic is important
- What this review covers
- How the review is organized

### Main Themes (Core of the review)

For each major theme or subtopic:

#### Theme Name
- **Overview:** What is this theme about?
- **Key papers:** List 3-5 most important papers with brief descriptions
- **Current state:** Where is the research now?
- **Open questions:** What remains unknown?

### Key Researchers and Influential Papers
List the most influential researchers and their key contributions.

### Debates and Gaps
- Where do researchers disagree?
- What are the major controversies?
- What gaps exist in the research?
- What questions remain unanswered?

### Recent Trends
- What's emerging in the field?
- New methodologies or approaches?

## Example: Theme Section

### Theme: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

**Overview:**
This theme covers the evolution of deep learning approaches to NLP, from early neural networks to transformer models.

**Key Papers:**
1. **Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017)** - Introduced the transformer architecture, revolutionizing NLP.
2. **BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers (Devlin et al., 2019)** - Showed pre-training benefits for NLP tasks.
3. **GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (Brown et al., 2020)** - Demonstrated emergent abilities in large language models.

**Current State:**
The field has moved toward larger models and emergent capabilities. Key trends include:
- Scaling laws showing predictable improvements
- Emergent abilities at scale
- Focus on alignment and safety

**Open Questions:**
- How far can scaling go?
- What are the limits of current architectures?
- How to achieve reliable reasoning?

## Writing Tips

1. **Explain for non-experts** - Assume reader knows basics but not details
2. **Connect ideas** - Show how papers relate to each other
3. **Tell the story** - Explain the evolution, not just list papers
4. **Be critical** - Note limitations, but fairly
5. **Use examples** - Concrete examples clarify concepts
6. **Balance depth** - Cover major areas adequately without overwhelming detail
